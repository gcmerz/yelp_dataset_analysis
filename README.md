# Motivation and Background 
Where will a restaurant be most successful? Will a Chinese restaurant do better in Chinatown, 
or in an area where there aren't any Chinese places? This project sought to figure out what neighborhood 
factors impact restaurant success. Using various statistical models (Ridge Regressions, Random Forest, the 
ensemble method, and more) we were able to predict a restaurant's yelp! star rating with a root mean squared
error of .67.
